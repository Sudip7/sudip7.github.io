Today I learned is part of track records of my  daily learning spanning across different verticals.
Here are the list for today.

1. How can I be better developer, depeloping things of my own, build product, consume latest techology APIs. 
These are thoughts that constantly follow me. Last 4 years might not taught me how to better developer as per company's standard
but how to be better developer as a individual. How good am I in writting codes that question still put me on edge... As part of
self motivated learning I constantly seeks suggestions from renowned developers. 

Trisha Gee suggested to invest my time and energy building something of my known, language selection based on my liking and comfort.
This may help to boost confidence, learning new things in depth and experiment with features. Based on her and Jeff(SE daily) I have decided
to invest my time to learn Python in a better way. That may help me achieving following objectives.

a. Second programming language
b. Online code competetion
c. Writting automation scripts
d. May helpful in AI and IoT things era.

2. I do listen to SE daily podcast on regular basis for last few days and I really love it. The topic of discussion for past few weeks is Kubernetes.
  I have saved most of audio to my local system. Here are some list I found today to understands the K8s.
