A static site setup i.e. Github pages has the huge benefit of keeping all your data in one place: markup, styles and even content.
All the data and configuration are stored in Github respository providing flexibility and control over content. Any dependency on
third party external service(i.e.disqus) has huge detrimental impact on above described advantage.

Staticman handles user-generated content and transforms it into data files that sit in the GitHub repository, 
along with the rest of other content. It has below advantage/characterstics

1. Designed to work with Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
2. Free and open source. Run it on your own server as a Node.js app or go the free hosted route.
3. Complete control over the data/content, user experience, and user interface.
4. Not just for comments! Perfect for any sort of user generated content: reviews, comments, polls, and more.
5. User submitted content can be merged in automatically or moderated.


Need to add more detail with updated post.
