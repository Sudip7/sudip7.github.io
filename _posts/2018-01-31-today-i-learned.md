Today I learned is part of track records of my  daily learning spanning across different verticals.
Here are the list for today.


1. Software is not about technology, it's about people. Colaboration, sharing ideas/knowledge is far more important
than technical expertise. 

2. There are  vast difference between coder and programmer.

3. Work with the people those are smarter than you. 

4. If you are in your 30s and really want do something!!! Just go for it. You still afford it.

5. Don't try to be best. Try to be the first to change/adapt, be the first to take the challange. Be the first
to overcome the difficulties.

6. Overcome the challanges and create the opportunities. Bigger the challange bigger the opportunity.

7. The next 30 year is the era of data technology(DT)
