Tada is a small town in the Chitoor district of Andhra Pradesh, India. Famous for it's falls and trecking experience among tracker
enthusiasts. Approx distance of 80-90 kms from Chennai is perfect weekend gateway. Bus, train or private vehicle all modes of transport 
can be used to reach this place. This blog is about my personal experience at Tada.

After lots of look up for a long weekend we finally settled for Tada coz of easily available transportation without the fuss of advance booking.
Originally planned with 3 members we finally settled with just two members. We started our journey as early as 5 am from Chennai Central station. It costs
only Rs 25 to reach Tada. From there we booked a auto to reach the forest checkpost. Although we are warned for longer walk, we preferred to enjoy early morning
treck. From check post it's about 3-4 km till base camp or so it's called. From base camp it's around 3 km to reach the point where most of people prefer to stop
and enjoy the nature. We are no exception as it's our first treck we decided not to take any unnecessary risk of going higher.
