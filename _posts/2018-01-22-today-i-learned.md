2. As I really like to be developer not just for my day job but as person, I seek opinion from different people most prominently
twitter. Had a brief chat followed by email communication with Software Engineer Daily Host : Jeff. I really enjoy his podcast. It's 
my daily dose of getting new ideas on technology. Here are some of suggestions I may look into.
  
  i) In order to become better developer I need to build/develope things of my own as pet projects.
  ii) Java as language is more suitable for enterprise level contribution, I may need to invest on a secondary language.
  iii) That language could be ExpressJS, Ruby and Rails or Python.
  iv) I don't to put much time on javascript framework as their life span very brief. So it's a choice between Ruby Vs Python.
  v) While both are very popular language with huge fan base; Ruby is more alligned towards web developement while Python is more generalistic language.
  vi) Based on above considerations, I would like to learn, experiment on Python. 
  vii) I can use my Python expertise in below areas
       a. As secondary programming language.
       b. Code competetion.
       c. Writting automation scripts.
       d. Developing faster and smaller POC for my ideas.
       e. Interact with cloud provider APIs.
       
3. As suggested by Jeff, in order to be cloud expert, I need to first interact/experience with cloud provider APIs. 
   I may try something like below
   i) Try with Pivotal Cloud Foundary Dev in local workstation.
   ii) Try full scale PCF, Heroku, AWS, Azure or Google cloud for lots of tutorials with web frameworks.
   iii) May try more advanced concepts like Google search API, Tensorflow or Cloud vision API.
